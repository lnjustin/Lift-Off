# Lift Off

Follow, and automate based on, the Space-X launch schedule.

- Graphical tile for your dashboard showing the patch and launch time for the latest/next launch
- Retains latest launch info, including success or failure, for 24 hours. Then populates with next launch info.
- Automate based on launch time, launch location, and/or rocket type. For example, set up to be notified on the day when a Falcon 9 rocket is to be launched from Kennedy Space Center.
- Switch turns on when it's a launch day.
